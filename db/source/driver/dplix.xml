    From original "INSTALL" file:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;i&gt;This driver is for the Dell 3010cn color laser
    printer. It's basically a rebadged Fuji-Xerox printer, with some
    fairly advanced features. Of course, none of the features it has
    are tied to the Windows(tm) OS in any way, shape, or form. But,
    due to the short-sightedness of all the companies involved with
    the manufacture of this printer, it was presented as such even
    though something as trivial as documentation would have gone a
    long way towards redeeming this particular oversight. But enough
    ranting, we have mended the situation with the present
    driver. :-)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    The driver is still in a very basic state and has several TODOs,
    but it makes the printer at least working.&lt;p&gt;

    As the PPD file is contained in the driver package we will not
    provide PPD files here on OpenPrinting.&lt;p&gt;
