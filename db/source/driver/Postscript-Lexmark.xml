      Under this entry Lexmark's PPD files for their PostScript printers
      are hosted. PostScript printers are supported natively in Linux
      and Unix environments, so you only need the PPD file for your
      printer, no driver executables, to get access to all printing
      functionality. The PPD contains all information about properties
      and user-settable options which are specific to the printer and
      makes printing dialogs show these options and allow the user to
      control all the printer's functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      The PPDs only support the printing functionality of the
      printers. To use extra functionality, like scanning and faxing
      you will need additional drivers.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript
      printers, with &lt;a
      href="show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript"&gt;generic PostScript
      PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all the
      printer specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
