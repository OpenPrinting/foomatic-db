      This basic PPD file based on Postscript is made for Linux/UNIX environment.
      PostScript printers are natively supported in Linux and UNIX environments (including Chrome OS),
      so you only need this PPD file for your printer, no driver executables,
      to get access to all printing functionality.
      Especially this PPD file supports some advanced printer features like Locked Print, Document Server,
      User Code… Note that although the printers are PostScript printers this PPD file needs foomatic-rip.
      Please see the &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ&quot;&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      This PPD file is for Japan models and some features might be displayed even if they are not supported by your printer.
      Please set the Paper Size, Paper Source, Duplex, Resolution, Collate, Paper Type, Staple
      and Punch features according to your printer's specification.&lt;p&gt;
