    This is an adaptation of the hp850 driver done by Rene' Harsch.
    It supports the 970's duplexer, although when duplex is on there
    is a minor quality issue. &lt;p&gt;

    This driver, like all modern HP drivers, was written by
    reverse-engineering part of the command set for the printer.  HP
    refused to help; Rene' sensibly suggests that people not buy HP
    products because of this uncoperative policy.&lt;P&gt;

    Rene's web page, with the instructions, is in German.
    German-impaired readers can probably follow them anyway; they're
    step-by-step and show all the commands to build the driver.
    &lt;p&gt;

    The driver takes the same arguments as the &lt;a
    href="show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj850" 
 &gt;cdj850&lt;/a&gt;
    driver, plus the three described on Rene's website.

    Very high quality for images/photos, colours more intensive than
    with the cdj880 driver.

    The printer works fine with this driver, since the 950C, 970cxi
    (se) and 990cxi (se) are nearly identical (duplexing-unit,
    papertraysize, ppm, ir-port differ).  Like mentioned in the
    driver, the modes for glossy and transparancy have a big loss of
    saturation which should be fixed. The driver from gimp works much
    better. Someone (maybe me) should have a closer look...
