      Under this entry Ricoh's PPD files for their NRG-branded
      PostScript printers are hosted. PostScript printers are
      supported natively in Linux and Unix environments, so you only
      need the PPD file for your printer, no driver executables, to
      get access to all printing functionality. The PPD contains all
      information about properties and user-settable options which are
      specific to the printer and makes printing dialogs show these
      options and allow the user to control all the printer's
      functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      These PPDs are especially made for use on Linux/Unix
      systems. Especially they support all advanced printer features
      like Locked Print, Ducument Server, User Code, ... Note that
      although the printers are PostScript printers these PPD files
      need foomatic-rip. See the &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ&quot;&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript
      printers, with &lt;a
      href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript&quot;&gt;generic PostScript
      PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all the
      printer-specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
