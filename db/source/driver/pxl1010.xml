    "pxl1010" is not a new driver, but a special way of using the
    "pxlmono" Ghostscript driver to make the HP LaserJet 1010 and 1012
    work reliably.  The trick is to add a special sequence of 8 bytes
    at the BeginSession operator of the PCL-XL data stream.&lt;p&gt;

    Simply using "pxlmono" does not print anything and using a PCL-5e
    driver (HPIJS, "ljet4", ...) leads in principle to the jobs being
    printed, but sometimes the printer crashes with an "Unsupported
    personality: PCL" message.&lt;p&gt;

    Thanks to Carl Michal (michal at physics dot ubc dot ca) for
    finding out that. He analyzed the output of the Windows driver,
    where he found this "magic" 8-byte sequence.&lt;p&gt;

    The PPDs from this site use an ugly Perl workaround to patch
    Ghostscript's output data stream in order to make paper tray
    selection work as the driver has a bug which breaks this
    functionality. This &lt;a
    href="http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/inputslot.patch"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;
    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the
    input tray with the "-dMediaPosition=X" commmand line option for
    Ghostscript. "X" is an integer number which depends on the printer
    model and tray. For HP "0" is usually the printer default, "1"
    automatic selection, "2" manual feed, "4" the upper, and "5" the
    lower tray. Note that for PCL 5/5e these numbers are
    different.&lt;p&gt;
