      This PPD file based on Postscript is made for Linux/UNIX environment.
      PostScript printers are natively supported Linux and UNIX environments,
      so you only need this PPD file for your printer, no driver executables,
      to get access to all printing functionality.
      Especially this PPD file supports some advanced printer features like Locked Print, Document Server,
      User Code… Note that although the printers are PostScript printers this PPD file needs foomatic-rip.
      Please see the &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ&quot;&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript
      printers, with &lt;a
      href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript&quot;&gt;generic PostScript
      PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all the
      printer-specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
