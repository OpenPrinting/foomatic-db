    Driver for the Pentax PocketJet series written by Rildo Pragana
    (author of the &quot;ml85p&quot; driver for Samsung laser
    winprinters) in cooperation with Pentax.&lt;p&gt;
 
    Rildo's announcement for this driver:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;i&gt;Pentax Technologies manufacture a nice family of printers,
    PocketJet II and PocketJet 200. They signed a contract with me for
    developing a Linux driver for their printers, to be released under
    GPL. So they are good guys, don't you think so? I do. I'm still
    working on it, but here is the first public release of the driver,
    with graphical install and configuration tools. If you have a
    laptop or notebook computer, those printers are a must to
    have. They operate on thermal paper, so no ink cartdriges to
    change. And its size and weight are very convenient. I know
    because I use mine :^)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    The driver is a wrapper around Ghostscript, so you only call the
    driver executable with some simple options to print from the
    command line. This makes it also very convenient to use the driver
    without spooler, which is important on PDAs with limited memory
    space.
