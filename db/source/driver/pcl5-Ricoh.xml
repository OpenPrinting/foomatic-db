      &lt;B&gt;This driver is available in the &lt;A href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ghostscript-printer-app&quot;&gt;Ghostscript Printer Application&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/ghostscript-printer-app/embedded?button=black&amp;summary=true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCC; border-radius: 2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      This PCL5-based PPD file is made for the Linux/UNIX environment. Linux and UNIX environments natively support PCL5 printers, so only this PPD file is needed for your printer to access all printing functionality. This PPD file supports general printer features. 
      &lt;b&gt;Note: This PCL5 PPD file requires rastertohp.&lt;/b&gt; Please see the &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ&quot;&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      This PPD file is for specific models, but because of the limitations below, some features might not be able to be selected even if they are supported by your printer. Please set your printer to correspond with the driver UI.&lt;p&gt;

      PCL5 PPD uses filter (rastertohp) that bundled with OS, because of the limitation of filter, there are following limitation in PCL5 PPD.&lt;p&gt;
      1. The PCL5 driver only support the following 12 paper sizes:
         Monarch Envelope, A5, DL Envelope, C5 Envelope, COM-10 Envelope, B5 Envelope, Executive, Letter, A4, Legal, A3, Tabloid&lt;p&gt;
      2. When &quot;Short Edge&quot; of Duplex (Two-sided) is set, the output will be printed as &quot;Long Edge&quot;.&lt;p&gt;
