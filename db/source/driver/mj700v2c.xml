      Special japanese printer driver.&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;b&gt;This driver is a candidate for being marked obsolete with
      "stcolor" as recommended replacement.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      This driver was not maintained any more for longer time and is
      &lt;a
      href="http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689595"&gt;broken
      in current Ghostscript&lt;/a&gt;. Please use "stcolor" for these
      printers. They are not (yet) listed as supported by "stcolor"
      but this driver is probably the one which will most probably
      work. Please try similar models, especially the Epson Stylus
      800. If you have found a suitable driver and printer model,
      preferably one which we did not mark as obsolete, please tell us
      by reporting a bug on our &lt;a
      href="http://bugs.linux-foundation.com/"&gt;bug tracking
      system&lt;/a&gt;. Choose "OpenPrinting" as product and
      "foomatic-db" as component.&lt;p&gt;
