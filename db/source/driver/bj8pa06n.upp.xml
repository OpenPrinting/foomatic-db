    This is a set of UPP files for the Canon BJC-8200 which comes with
    GhostScript 6.50 or newer. It supports several modes up to the
    highest resolution on photo papers. GIMP-Print also supports this
    model, but it is not known which driver gives the better results.
    &lt;P&gt;

    The documentation to this driver (see driver&apos;s web page) tells
    that with this driver the maximum printout quality is reached, even
    it supports only 4-ink printing, but the Windows driver also uses
    only four inks in its highest quality modes.&lt;P&gt;

    The printing system/execution information for this driver serves
    also for the other bj8*.upp drivers.
