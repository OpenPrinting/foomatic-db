    This is HP&apos;s first printer made especially for printing
    photos, it takes A4/Letter as maximum paper sizes (no Legal paper)
    and works exclusively with a 6-color printing process
    (CcMmYK). Due to the black ink being together with the light cyan
    and light magenta ink in one cartridge it is totally uneconomic to
    print text and office work with this printer.&lt;p&gt;

    For basic printing functionality use the &lt;a 
    href=&quot;http://hpinkjet.sf.net/&quot;&gt;HPIJS 
    driver &lt;/a&gt;. For advanced functionality such
    as printer status and maintenance features, use the
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://hpinkjet.sf.net/&quot;&gt;
    HPLIP driver&lt;/a&gt; (which includes HPIJS). &lt;p&gt;

    The protocol of this printer is different to the one of the
    DeskJet and of the later PhotoSmart models, especially HP says
    that it does not work under DOS because it has no built-in
    fonts. A driver to use this printer under free operating systems
    is not known.&lt;p&gt;
