    One user reported that the driver downloaded from the Samsung web
    site makes this printer working perfectly out of the box on Fedora
    Core 5.&lt;p&gt;

    Another user reported that once the (Samsung) driver is installed
    with a lot of pain, it fails to communicate properly with CUPS. It
    is just a frustrating experience. He returned the printer to the
    store, after the Samsung technical support told on the phone that
    they do not support Linux anyway.&lt;p&gt;

    The user H.Samm reported that his printer worked out of the
    box... so far his experience has been a very good one.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: cartridge CA$ 90&lt;p&gt;
