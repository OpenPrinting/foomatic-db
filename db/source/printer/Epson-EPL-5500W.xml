    <en>Doesn't seem to print without its &quot;Windows Printing System&quot;. Connected to a Windows box the software emulates Laserjet2. This allows you to print via Samba with 300x300 dpi.
&lt;br&gt;Keep in mind that there is no support for any Windows but Win95 and Win3.1(1).
&lt;br&gt;Prints out completely black pages if Windows Box has not enough memory available.
&lt;br&gt;Important! Mind the &quot;W&quot;, there's a EPL-5500 without &quot;W&quot;, too, this one might work.</en>
