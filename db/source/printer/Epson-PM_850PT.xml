    Japanese version of the Epson Stylus Photo 925.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer has slots for CompactFlash, SmartMedia, and Sony
    Memory Stick photo memory cards. so one can print photos without
    PC. The front panel has a graphical user interface which gives
    many options for printing from photo cards. There is also a
    connector for a little color LCD monitor for choosing the photos
    to print. Photo download works with kernel 2.4.21 or later. The memory card can be simply mounted as a
    USB-mass-storage device then.&lt;p&gt;

    6-color CMYKcm printing.&lt;p&gt;

    Roll paper feeder with cutter. Roll paper handling works as with
    older Epson Stylus Photo models, there are no control options for
    the cutter in GIMP-Print yet and when one presses the "Roll Feed"
    button on the front panel to eject the printout, it is cut, but
    near 2 cm after the image, leaving a white border. So for
    correctly cut photos you have to copy them onto a memory card and
    then print via the front panel.&lt;p&gt;

    USB only.&lt;p&gt;
