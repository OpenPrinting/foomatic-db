    Prints with the lxm3200 driver in all resolutions, but only in
    bidirectional mode, colours off (I think it is a GhostScript
    problem), 300 dpi too light, 600 too dark, 1200 flooded with
    ink.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer is really slow and somewhat flimsy. It is capable of
    fairly good output, though.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lexmark.com&quot;&gt;Lexmark&lt;/a&gt;
    provides a Linux/x86 binary-only driver for this printer.  &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://www.picante.com/~gtaylor/&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt;
    have this printer and a beta of the driver; the combo works fairly
    well. But don&apos;t buy the thing because of this; buy a printer
    that works with proper free software.&lt;p&gt;

    To obtain the driver simply follow the &quot;Drivers&quot; link on
    the home page. Lexmark&apos;s driver does not work with Debian
    Woody using alien, and it indeed isn&apos;t listed as
    supported.&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;
    galaxie:~# lexmarkz32
    lexmarkz32: Symbol `__ti7VDKForm&apos; has different size in shared object, consider re-linking
    lexmarkz32: error while loading shared libraries: lexmarkz32: undefined symbol: __7VDKFormP14VDKApplicationPci13GtkWindowType
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

    ...bummer. It works against Debian potato and Helix Gnome; that
    library error probably stems from a mismatch between the expected
    Gtk library (the gui is built using vdk, a c++ wrapper thing, I
    guess) and whatever you&apos;ve got. I would expect the z32 binary
    to still work. Then you can print with all spoolers using the
    Lexmark Foomatic Kit mentioned below.&lt;p&gt;

    The drivers issued by Lexmark do not contain any CUPS or PDQ
    configuration file, so use them either with LPD or with my &lt;a
    href=&quot;download/printing/lexmark-foomatic-kit.tar.gz&quot;&gt;Lexmark
    Foomatic Kit&lt;/a&gt;. Download it, uncompress it, and follow the
    instructions of its README file. Due to having access to all
    options of the driver it leads even to a better printout quality
    than the Lexmark driver with its original configuration
    software.&lt;p&gt;</en>
