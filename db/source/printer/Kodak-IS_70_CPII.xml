    Is not sold for much longer, but will still be used in many
    professional environments for a number of years because of its
    still unique feature combination: 70 ppm; can do 3 different spot
    colors concurrently (on top of default b+w printing); duplex
    capabilities; a finishing device which can fold A3 and A4 paper;
    thus outputting ready-made A4 and A5 booklets complete with a
    saddle-stitched stapling; run by an Adobe PostScript Level 2 RIP
    which lives in a SUN Sparc workstation.  I used the original PPD
    (supposedly just written to support MacOS and MS Win printing)
    with CUPS, which used its LPD backend to send the PostScript to
    the printer. In this way all options of the printer can be
    used.&lt;p&gt;
