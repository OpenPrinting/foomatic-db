    I used the original PPD with CUPS (supposedly just written to
    support MacOS and MS Win printing). All options can be used:
    select 1 of 5 trays; choose A4, Letter, A3 etc.; duplex printing;
    safe toner (draft printing); switch back to 400 dpi;inline
    finishing with stapling and punching (if you&apos;ve got the
    Finisher 3000 installed).&lt;p&gt;

    The standard equipment is with PDL support of PCL 5e and PCL 6;
    you can have PostScript 3 as an option - this
 is what I had at
    my disposal and what I only used.&lt;p&gt;

    It is doing 65 A4 ppm and is good for 20.000 to 120.000 prints per
    month. This machine is often to be found in semi-professional
    environments, large offices etc. with the named printing
    volume.&lt;p&gt;

    It is an OEM product based on a nearly identical Ricoh device (the
    Ricoh name of which I&apos;ll have to find out first).&lt;p&gt;
