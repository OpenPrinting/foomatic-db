    The &quot;Product Manager Operating Systems&quot; of Epson France
    told me that this device is compatible to the Epson Stylus Color
    740 printer and the Epson GT 7000 scanner. Both these devices work
    under free operating systems, so this device should be fully
    functional. &lt;p&gt;

    Works with the 2.2 kernel backported USB, and probably on kernel
    2.4. It's unclear if there is any code to drive the scanner
    via parallel port; is this a IEEE muxed parport device, or is it
    running something funky?  &lt;p&gt;

    The scanner was reported to work by a &quot;Steve
    Morningthunder&quot; over in the &lt;a
    href=&quot;http://lhd.datapower.com/db/dispproduct.php3?DISP?1897&quot;&gt;LHD&lt;/a&gt;:
    Used usb-2.4.0-test2-pre~2.2.16-v3 backport to kernel 2.2.16 and
    modified scanner.h in /drivers/usb/ to include&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;pre&gt;
   { 0x04b8, 0x0106 }, /* Stylus Scan 2500 */
    &lt;/pre&gt;
 
    for the seiko/epson category.  &lt;p&gt;

    The printer is reported to work with the stcolor driver; it almost
    certainly works much better with the stp driver.  Someone will
    have to experiment to determine which stp driver Model value to
    use.
