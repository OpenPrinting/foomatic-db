    I used the original PPD (supposedly just written to support MacOS
    and MS Win printing) with CUPS, which used its LPD backend to send
    the PostScript to the printer. In this way all options can be
    used: select 1 of 6 trays; choose A4, Letter, A3 etc.; use cover,
    chapter and insert sheets; duplex printing; impose as a booklet;
    inline finishing with stapling or (in the case of a booklet)
    folding, saddle-stitching, edge trimming to a finished A4 or A5
    booklet.&lt;p&gt;

    This is a professional 110 ppm printer for large commercial print
    shops, originally developed by Kodak; also marketed by DANKA
    (http://www.danka.de or http://www.danka.com) internationally, who
    might have even more experience with service and maintenance of
    this device than Heidelberg who bought its manufacturing and
    further development off Kodak. This more than 1 million prints per
    month capable monster prints TIFF, PDF 1.2, PostScript 3, PCL 5;
    it runs on the output of an Adobe RIP powered by a SUN UltraSparc
    60.&lt;p&gt;
