    Like the Epson Stylus C82, but faster. C83 and C84 are the same,
    C83 is the name for the European and C84 for the US market. These
    printers are also capable of full-bleed (borderless)
    printing.&lt;p&gt;

    Parallel and USB ports.&lt;p&gt;

    With Gimp-Print 4.2.2 or newer it will work (except full-bleed) when
    choosing the Epson Stylus C82 as printer model, with older Gimp-Print
    versions when choosing the C80 as printer model.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer cannot be tested by sending plain text to it, as the
    printer may or may not respond to the text.  The recommended way
    to test the connection is by checking the ink level with the
    &lt;tt&gt;escputil&lt;/tt&gt; command as follows:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    where /dev/lp0 should be replaced with the name of your printer
    port.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: Four separately changable cartridges for black and the
	colours&lt;p&gt;
