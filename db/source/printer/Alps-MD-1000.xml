    J.C. Bradfield (jcb@dcs.ed.ac.uk) has written a fully functional
    driver which converts PPM files (&quot;ppmtomd&quot;). He started
    hacking ghostscript, but abandoned it.&lt;p&gt;

    The &quot;md2k&quot; driver is documented only in
    Japanese.&lt;p&gt;

    &quot;md2k&quot; is reported to work, but suffers from some banding and
    dithering problems. The driver supports all features but
    metallic, white, or multicolour cartridges.&lt;p&gt;
