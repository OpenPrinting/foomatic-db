    Epson provides a free (LGPL) driver for this printer. With this
    the printer should work to its full extent.&lt;p&gt;

    Unfortunately, Epson&apos;s &quot;epl5900&quot; driver (or perhaps
    the printer&apos;s firmware) is somewhat buggy. It prints most
    documents, but images converted to PostScript with
    &quot;convert&quot; or by the built-in filters of CUPS leads often
    to incorrect printouts (stretched by a factor of 3 or 4 in
    horizontal direction).&lt;p&gt;

    Further tests with the &quot;pxlmono&quot; driver did not show
    this problem. The printer works perfectly in 1200 dpi with this
    driver, only full-page photos take very long to be
    rendered.&lt;p&gt;

    It is really strange that the native driver from Epson does not
    work correctly but a driver for an emulation mode.
