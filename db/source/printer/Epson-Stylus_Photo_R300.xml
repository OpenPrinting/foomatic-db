    For this printer basic support is available in Gimp-Print 5.0.x,
    fine tuning, testing, and support for printing on CDs still has to
    be done.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer has slots for all common types of photo memory
    cards. so one can print photos without PC. The front panel has a
    graphical user interface which gives many options for printing
    from photo cards. There is also a a little color LCD monitor
    included for choosing the photos to print. Photo download works
    with kernel 2.4.21 or later. The memory card can be simply mounted
    as a USB-mass-storage device then. A USB port in the printer
    allows also to connect PictBridge-compatible cameras, ZIP or
    CD-ROM drives for photo printing.&lt;p&gt;

    6-color CMYKcm printing, printing on inkjet-printable CDs and DVDs
    possible (not yet supported by Gimp-Print).&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: 6 separately exchangeable ink cartridges&lt;p&gt;
