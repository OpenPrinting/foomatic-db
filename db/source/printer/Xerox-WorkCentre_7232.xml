      ATTENTION The printer firmware Version 1.203.5 has a bug and prints only the first page of a printjob that has multiple tiff documents like lpr -Pprinter page1.tif page2.tif. Windows driver does not work when distributed by point and print over a samba server!!!!! (Looks like it needs bidirectional communication?)
This is the first xerox machine that i have that can be set up to use ntp to set the clock. It's web interface is poor, you can't access all configurations. PostScript is OPTIONAL ($). We tested only with ethernet, large paper bin and PostScript option installed. We use email to send pdf, and use a mail2fax gateway to send faxes from the machine. PDF compression uses JBIG2 by default, which cannot be processed with current ghostscript properly (6.81).
