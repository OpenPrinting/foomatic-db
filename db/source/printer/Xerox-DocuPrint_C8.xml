    <en>&lt;p&gt;From other notes for printers usinf PCL3c
It looks as if you should be able to
do 1200x600.  I haven't seen this happen yet
but will update this page when possible.
Printer control functions are also missing.
(ie. ink level, align, clean).  This printer
 reacts badly to port polling so define the port
 address and irq before using or the printer
 will never shut off.

&lt;p&gt;Note from someone else: The Red Hat test page
came out shifted about 3 inches to the right
(and cropped on the right, of course).  The fix
is to set the margins to 0 (default is 18, which
is supposed to be in points; guess there's a units
problem).

&lt;p&gt;Note to UK users: You can buy this printer really cheap (40 quid) at www.freecolourprinters.co.uk.
I've no connection with them except as a satisfied purchaser.
Here's the correct magic to put in your /etc/modules.conf:
&lt;br&gt;alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
&lt;br&gt;options parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7
&lt;br&gt;(obviously change the io and irq to suit your setup)&lt;p&gt;
