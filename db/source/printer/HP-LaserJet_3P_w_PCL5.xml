    The LaserJet 3P with PCL5 extension is nearly compatible to the
    LaserJet 4L with the exception that it does not support PJL
    (Printing Job Language). So it can be used with the
    &quot;ljet4&quot; GhostScript driver or with GIMP-Print. Do not
    use HPIJS, as it always adds PJL commands which get printed on an
    extra page.&lt;p&gt;

    Make sure you have at least 2MB RAM, otherwise it won&apos;t be
    able to print complex pages.&lt;p&gt;

    Widely available this workhorse just keeps going and going. It
    also uses about the cheapest toner available. Remanufactured toner
    is about $25, and Xerox sells new units for about $50. Cheaper to
    run than ANY inkjet. Keep your eyes open for used HP LJIII or
    IIID&apos;s they are a good buy.&lt;p&gt;

    Warning !!!&lt;p&gt;

    If you have only 1MB of printer RAM: This printer supports 300dpi
    only under text mode.  If you try to print graphic pages with this
    resolution, only 3/4 of the page will get printed and you&apos;ll
    get MEM OVERFLOW.  For a full page in graphics mode, you have to
    set the resolution to 150x150dpi...
