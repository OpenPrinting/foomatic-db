    Sophisticated, but not too expensive 4-ink small-office
    printer. With 20ppm for black text (economy mode) it is very fast
    for an inkjet, faster than many older desktop lasers. Very durable
    water- and light proof printouts and high printing quality on
    normal paper due to pigment inks.&lt;p&gt;

    180 nozzles black, 3x60 nozzles for the colours, 3 pl droplets,
    variable drop size.&lt;p&gt;

    Parallel and USB ports.&lt;p&gt;

    Full support in Gimp-Print 4.1.99b3 or newer.&lt;p&gt;

    Epson only advertises a resolution of 2880x720 for this printer
    (whicch is currently the maximum resolution with the Windows/MacOS
    drivers) with Gimp-Print 4.1.99rc1 and newer it does real
    2880x1440 dpi. For drawings with fine details 1440x1440 dpi is
    recommended because this makes fine vertical and horizontal lines
    having equal widths.&lt;p&gt;

    This printer cannot be tested by sending plain text to it, as the
    printer may or may not respond to the text.  The recommended way
    to test the connection is by checking the ink level with the
    &lt;tt&gt;escputil&lt;/tt&gt; command as follows:&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;tt&gt;escputil -i -u -r /dev/lp0&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    where /dev/lp0 should be replaced with the name of your printer
    port.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      Consumables/Refills: Four separately changable cartridges for black and the
	colours&lt;p&gt;
